            <p>Prep Time: 10 minutes | Cook Time: 5 minutes | Total Time: 15 minutes | Servings:</p>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 pound plant-based protein or vegetable patty</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon egg substitute</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon plant-based milk</li>
                <li>Seasonings: Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion powder, Pepper, or other spices of choice</li>
                <li>1 burger bun</li>
                <li>Cheese (optional, plant-based)</li>
                <li>Toppings (optional): lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, mustard</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Form the plant-based protein or vegetable mixture into a small patty and add the crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs, soy sauce, egg substitute, plant-based milk, and seasonings. Mix well.</li>
                <li>Cook the patty on a grill or stovetop (using a small cast iron skillet) until heated through and browned on the outside.</li>
                <li>Assemble the burger by applying a small amount of sauce, followed by a slice of plant-based cheese (if using), a lettuce leaf, a tomato slice, a few slices of red onion, and finally a dollop of dill pickle slices (if using).</li>
                <li>Serve on a toasted burger bun.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a small cast iron skillet to cook the patty, as it retains heat well.</li>
                <li>Don't press down on the patty while it's cooking, as it can make it dense and lose juices.</li>
                <li>Keep the toppings simple, as the focus is on the juicy patty.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="2food">French Fries Recipe:</h2>
            <p>Crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and utterly addictive - who can resist the charm of French Fries? Here's a simple recipe to make perfect French Fries at home:</p>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2-3 large potatoes</li>
                <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>Salt, to taste</li>
                <li>Optional: Additional seasonings such as paprika, garlic powder, or chili powder</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Peel and Cut the Potatoes:</strong> Peel the potatoes and cut them into long, thin strips. Rinse the strips in cold water to remove excess starch, then dry them thoroughly with paper towels.</li>
                <li><strong>Heat the Oil:</strong> Heat the vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or a deep fryer to 350°F (180°C).</li>
                <li><strong>Fry the Potatoes:</strong> Carefully add the potato strips to the hot oil in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for 3-5 minutes or until they turn golden brown.</li>
                <li><strong>Drain and Season:</strong> Remove the French Fries from the oil with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Sprinkle with salt and any additional seasonings you like.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Serve the French Fries hot and enjoy with your favorite dipping sauce!</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Tips and Variations:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>For extra crispy French Fries, try soaking the cut potatoes in cold water for 30 minutes before frying.</li>
                <li>Experiment with different seasonings and toppings, such as grated cheese, diced herbs, or spicy mayo.</li>
                <li>For a healthier option, try baking the French Fries in a preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for 20-25 minutes, or until crispy and golden brown.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>

                    <li>1 cup finely chopped mixed vegetables (such as carrots, bell peppers, and cabbage)</li>
                    <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon ginger paste</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
                    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup chili oil</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon chopped cilantro</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon chopped scallions</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Make the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking powder. Gradually add the warm water and mix until a smooth dough forms. Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes until it becomes soft and pliable. Cover and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a separate mixing bowl, combine the chopped vegetables, chopped onion, minced garlic, ginger paste, soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all the ingredients are well combined.</li>
                <li><strong>Assemble the Momos:</strong> Divide the dough into small balls, about the size of a small egg. Roll out each ball into a thin circle.

                <li><strong>Steam the Momos:</strong> In a large steamer basket, place the Momos in a single layer, leaving some space between each Momo. Steam the Momos over boiling water for 15-20 minutes, or until they're cooked through and fluffy.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Serve the steamed Momos hot with the dipping sauce. Garnish with additional cilantro and scallions, if desired.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Tips and Variations:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Add some vegetables, such as cabbage or carrots, to the filling for added nutrition.</li>
                <li>Experiment with different spices, such as cumin or coriander, to give the Momos a unique flavor.</li>
                <li>Try pan-frying the Momos instead of steaming them for a crispy exterior.</li>
